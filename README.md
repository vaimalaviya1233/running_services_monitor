## Requirements

### Essential
- **Android 7.0 (API 24) or higher**
- **Shizuku app** installed and running
- For Android 11+: Wireless Debugging enabled
- For Android 10 and below: ADB connection to PC

### Permissions
- `QUERY_ALL_PACKAGES` - To list all installed apps
- Shizuku permission - Granted through Shizuku app

## Installation

### 1. Install Shizuku

Download and install Shizuku from:
- [Google Play Store](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=moe.shizuku.privileged.api)
- [GitHub Releases](https://github.com/RikkaApps/Shizuku/releases)

### 2. Start Shizuku Service

#### For Android 11 and above (Wireless Debugging):
1. Enable **Developer Options** on your device
2. Enable **Wireless Debugging** in Developer Options
3. Open Shizuku app
4. Tap **"Pair"** or **"Start"**
5. Follow the on-screen pairing instructions

#### For Android 10 and below (ADB via PC):
1. Enable **Developer Options** and **USB Debugging**
2. Connect your device to a PC via USB
3. Run this ADB command on your PC:
   ```bash
   adb shell sh /storage/emulated/0/Android/data/moe.shizuku.privileged.api/start.sh
   ```
4. Shizuku should now be running

### 3. Install This App

Build and install the APK:
```bash
flutter build apk --release
flutter install
```

Or run in debug mode:
```bash
flutter run
```

### 4. Grant Shizuku Permission

When you first open the app, it will request Shizuku permission. Tap **"Allow"** when prompted.

## How It Works

This app uses Shizuku to execute privileged ADB commands without root access:

1. **Shizuku Integration**: The app connects to the Shizuku service running on your device
2. **Dumpsys Commands**: Executes `dumpsys activity services` to get running service information
3. **Parsing**: Parses the dumpsys output to extract service details (package name, PID, process name, etc.)
4. **Categorization**: Separates services into System and User categories

### Key Components

**ShizukuService**: Manages Shizuku initialization, permission requests, and command execution

**ProcessService**: Fetches running services using `dumpsys` and parses the output

**HomeScreen**: Main UI with three tabs (All, User, System) and refresh functionality

## Limitations

- **Android Restrictions**: Due to Android security policies, some service information may be limited
- **Shizuku Dependency**: Requires Shizuku to be running; service stops when device reboots
- **Parsing Accuracy**: Dumpsys output format may vary across Android versions
- **No Service Control**: This app only displays services; it cannot start/stop them

## Why Shizuku?

Starting from Android 8.0 (API 26), the `ActivityManager.getRunningServices()` API was deprecated and restricted. Third-party apps can no longer query all running services on the device for privacy and security reasons.

Shizuku provides a solution by:
- Running a privileged service that can access system APIs
- Allowing apps to execute ADB commands without root
- Working on non-rooted devices via Wireless Debugging (Android 11+) or USB ADB

## Troubleshooting

### "Shizuku is not running"
- Open the Shizuku app and start the service
- For Android 11+: Enable Wireless Debugging
- For Android 10-: Connect to PC and run the ADB command

### "Permission denied"
- Grant Shizuku permission when prompted
- Check that Shizuku service is running properly

### "No services found"
- Tap the refresh button
- Ensure Shizuku has proper permissions
- Check that dumpsys commands work in Shizuku app

### App crashes on startup
- Ensure minSdk is 24 or higher
- Verify all dependencies are installed: `flutter pub get`
- Check Android manifest configuration
