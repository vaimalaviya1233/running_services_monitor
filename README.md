## Requirements

### Essential
- **Android 7.0 (API 24) or higher**
- **Root access** (preferred) OR **Shizuku app** installed and running

### Permissions
- `QUERY_ALL_PACKAGES` - To list all installed apps
- Root permission OR Shizuku permission - The app first checks for root access, then falls back to Shizuku if root is unavailable

## Installation

### Option A: Rooted Device (Recommended)

1. Install the app from any of the sources above
2. When prompted, grant root permission
3. The app will use root access for all operations

### Option B: Non-Rooted Device (Using Shizuku)

#### 1. Install Shizuku

Download and install Shizuku from:
- [Google Play Store](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=moe.shizuku.privileged.api)
- [GitHub Releases](https://github.com/RikkaApps/Shizuku/releases)

#### 2. Start Shizuku Service

##### Wireless Debugging:
1. Enable **Developer Options** on your device
2. Enable **Wireless Debugging** in Developer Options
3. Open Shizuku app
4. Tap **"Pair"** or **"Start"**
5. Follow the on-screen pairing instructions

## How It Works

This app uses root access or Shizuku to execute privileged ADB commands:

1. **Permission Check**: The app first checks for root permission. If root is not available, it falls back to Shizuku
2. **Root Integration**: If rooted, executes commands directly with superuser privileges
3. **Shizuku Integration**: If not rooted, connects to the Shizuku service running on your device
4. **Dumpsys Commands**: Executes `dumpsys activity services` to get running service information
5. **Parsing**: Parses the dumpsys output to extract service details (package name, PID, process name, etc.)
6. **Categorization**: Separates services into System and User categories

## Why Root or Shizuku?

Starting from Android 8.0 (API 26), the `ActivityManager.getRunningServices()` API was deprecated and restricted. Third-party apps can no longer query all running services on the device for privacy and security reasons.

**Root access** provides the most seamless experience:
- Direct access to system commands
- No additional setup required
- Works on all rooted devices

**Shizuku** provides an alternative for non-rooted devices:
- Running a privileged service that can access system APIs
- Allowing apps to execute ADB commands without root
- Working on non-rooted devices via Wireless Debugging (Android 11+) or USB ADB

## Building from Source

```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/biplobsd/running_services_monitor.git
cd running_services_monitor

# Get dependencies
flutter pub get

# Generate code (Freezed models and localization)
dart run build_runner build --delete-conflicting-outputs
flutter gen-l10n

# Run on connected device
flutter run

# Build release APK (universal)
flutter build apk --release

# Build release APK (split per ABI for smaller file sizes)
flutter build apk --release --split-per-abi

# Build App Bundle for Play Store
flutter build appbundle --release
```

## Adding New Translations

### Using AI Agent (Recommended)

Use the following prompt with an AI agent to automate the entire process:

```
Add <language> localization to this project:
1. Create app_<localeName>.arb in lib/l10n/ by translating all values from lib/l10n/app_en.arb. Keep the keys unchanged.
2. Add the locale to android/app/src/main/res/xml/locales_config.xml
3. Run "flutter gen-l10n" and "dart run build_runner build --delete-conflicting-outputs" commands
4. how to create a PR for this change
```

After completion, verify all translations are correct.

### Manual Steps

#### Flutter Part

1. Create a new `app_<localeName>.arb` file in `lib/l10n/` (e.g., `app_es.arb` for Spanish)

2. Translate all fields from `app_en.arb` file to the new language

3. Run the following command in the project root:
   ```bash
   flutter gen-l10n
   ```

#### Android Part

1. Add the new locale to `android/app/src/main/res/xml/locales_config.xml`:
   ```xml
   <locale android:name="<localeName>" />
   ```
